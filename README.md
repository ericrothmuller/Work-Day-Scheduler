# Work-Day-Scheduler

This project, which I named Work-Day-Scheduler, is part of the 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler Challenge for U.C. Berkeley Extension's Coding Boot Camp. My name is Eric Rothmuller and I am a student of the Boot Camp. In this project I was tasked with creating a simple calendar application that allow sa user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The hour rows should highlight based on the current hour of the day including past, present, and future and use localStorage to save input data from users.
